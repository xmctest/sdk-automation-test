# Content SDK Component Registration (Pages Router)

Register components in the Sitecore component map so the layout and editing pipeline can resolve and render them. This app has a **single** map: `.sitecore/component-map.ts`.

## When to Use

- After scaffolding or adding a new Sitecore component (must be registered).
- User reports a component not rendering, "component not found," or layout/placeholder showing raw component name.
- Task involves `.sitecore/component-map.ts`.
- User asks how to register a component or fix component resolution.

## How to perform

- Open `.sitecore/component-map.ts` and add an entry mapping the layout component name to the React component import. The map is used by getComponentData and editing API routes; keep keys consistent with layout and existing entries.

## Hard Rules

- Every component rendered from Sitecore layout must be registered in `.sitecore/component-map.ts`. Keep the map in sync with `src/components/`.
- The map is used by `getComponentData(page.layout, context, components)` in the catch-all page and by editing API routes (`src/pages/api/editing/config.ts`, `render.ts`, `feaas/render.ts`).
- Use consistent component names (same key in map as used in layout). Follow existing naming in the map.
- Do not remove or rename registrations without updating all references (layout, getComponentData, editing routes).

## Stop Conditions

- Stop if modifying the component map would break existing layout or editing; suggest a safe change or ask for confirmation.
- Do not edit `.sitecore/metadata.json` or import-map unless the task explicitly requires it.
